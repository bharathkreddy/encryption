AES is a 128 bit symmetric key block cipher. This means it takes 128 bits of plaintext and converts it into a 128 bit ciphertext. This conversion happens using a key which can be 128 (10 rounds), 192 (12 rounds) or 256(14 rounds) bits. This is based on rijndael algorithm. This is extremely fast. 

The basis for AES is SP network which is an s-box ( substitution box ) over a p-box (permutation box)
